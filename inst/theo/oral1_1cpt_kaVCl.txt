DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).
This has been modified so that it will run without the model library


[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {ka, V, Cl}

EQUATION:

; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(ka, V, Cl)

OUTPUT:
output = Cc
