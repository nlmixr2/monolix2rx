  - Fixed; removed package name from the title since it is redundant

- Please proofread your DESCRIPTION.

  - It currently reads: "...to load its model library instead manually setting up text
   files (...). command line usage."

   - I believe it should be: "...to load its model library instead of
     manually setting up text files (...)."

 - Fixed.

Please fix and resubmit.
